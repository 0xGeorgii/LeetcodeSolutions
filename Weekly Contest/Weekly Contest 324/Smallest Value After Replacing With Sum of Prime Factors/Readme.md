https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-324/problems/smallest-value-after-replacing-with-sum-of-prime-factors/

You are given a positive integer `n`.

Continuously replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors.

- Note that if a prime factor divides `n` multiple times, it should be included in the sum as many times as it divides `n`.

Return the smallest value `n` will take on.
