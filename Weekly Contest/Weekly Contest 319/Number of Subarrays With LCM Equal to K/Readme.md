# Number of Subarrays With LCM Equal to K

https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-319/problems/number-of-subarrays-with-lcm-equal-to-k/

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of subarrays of nums where the least common multiple of the subarray's elements is `k`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

The least common multiple of an array is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the array elements.
