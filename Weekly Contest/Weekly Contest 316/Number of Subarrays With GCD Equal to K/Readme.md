# Number of Subarrays With GCD Equal to K

https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-316/problems/number-of-subarrays-with-gcd-equal-to-k/

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of **subarrays** of nums where the greatest common divisor of the subarray's elements is `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

The **greatest common divisor** of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.
