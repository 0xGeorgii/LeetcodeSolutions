# Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-321/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/

You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
