# Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle

https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-92/problems/minimum-cuts-to-divide-a-circle/

A valid cut in a circle can be:

- A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
- A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.

Given the integer `n`, return the minimum number of cuts needed to divide a circle into `n` equal slices.
